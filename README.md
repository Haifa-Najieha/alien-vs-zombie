# Alien vs. Zombie

Aina has a son named Mikael who loves to play video games. Mikael wants to play games that only contain Aliens and Zombies as the characters. Since Aina is a successful game developer in her company, she decides to create a game that inspired from an existing game which is Alien Path.
