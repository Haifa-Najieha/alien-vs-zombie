# Alien vs. Zombie

Morgan Stark is a child prodigy just like his father Tony Stark when he was young. At five years old, she
self-taught herself C++ and mastered the concepts of structured programming and object-based
programming.

Recently, she discovered a mobile game named Alien Path currently available in Android and iOS. In this
game, the player navigates an alien on a path to destroy robots. It combines several elements of role-
playing game, puzzle, path-planning, and strategy to provide a unique gaming experience.

Morgan intends to put her programming skills to the test by developing a simplified, text-based version
of this game, with several modifications of her own. She names her modified game as Alien vs. Zombie,
due to her peculiar soft spot for aliens and zombies.

You may add one signature screenshot of your program here or above the title. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images) to learn how to do it.
